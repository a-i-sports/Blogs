# Blogs
This contains all the code for our blog posts

<br>

## Instructions:
1. Folder naming convention is as follows:  
    - "Author name" + `_post_` + Date

    - Date format:  
      - YYYY-MM-DD

    - No capitalization  

    - e.g. `jason_post_2018-12-31`  

2. Inside the folder will include a `Readme.md` with instructions on how to reproduce the blog post contents along with a link to the given blog post.  

3. The code must be 100% reproducible and verified by an independent party.

4. It does not matter what language is used as long as it is clearly written and commented.
